## gdoc2rmd

Convert Google Doc HTML files to Rmarkdown.

Google Docs allows users to export their document as an HTML file. The raw HTML is rather complex, the styling is pretty weak, and there are limited choices for how to incorporate R tools with the plain HTML. This packages converts the GDoc HTML version to Rmarkdown, suitable for further editing.

### Requirements

[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) must be installed and on the `$PATH` for gdoc2rmd to work.
