Description: Google Docs allows users to export their document as an HTML file.
    The raw HTML is rather complex, the styling is pretty weak, and there are
    limited choices for how to incorporate R tools with the plain HTML. This
    packages converts the GDoc HTML version to Rmarkdown, suitable for further
    editing.
